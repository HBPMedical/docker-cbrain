# Instructions:
#
# 1) Copy this file as 'config_portal.rb' in the current directory.
#
# 2) Edit your copy to suit your deployment environement.
#    DO NOT CHECK-IN your file 'config_portal.rb' !
#
# 3) Leave this template alone; when new configuration options are
#    added to CBRAIN, they will show up here as this file is under version
#    control. The file 'validation_portal.rb' will warn you and
#    you'll have to update your .rb file based on the .rb.TEMPLATE.

class CBRAIN

  # Name for this CBRAIN app; this is MANDATORY and must
  # match an entry in the remote_resources table of the DB.
  # If the application is booting for the first time, a
  # dummy entry will be created by the sanity checks.
  #
  # If the name is changed with the interface, then this
  # file must be adjusted accordingly.
  CBRAIN_RAILS_APP_NAME = {{ default .Env.CBRAIN_APP_NAME "\"CBRAIN\"" }}

  # All other configuration variables are now stored
  # in the database, and there is an interface to edit them!
  # If any other old CBRAIN constants are defined here, the
  # system checks will migrate them to the DB first and
  # then you'll be required to remove them.
